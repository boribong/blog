<center>Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cell in the human circulation and play a key role in host defense and acute inflammation. Neutrophils have the ability to directionally migrate in a gradient of chemoattractant stimuli to distant targets of infection and inflammation. However, if cells become lost and migrate to healthy tissues, they can simultaneously mediate tissue damage and be dysfunctional in antimicrobial defense. This dysfunctional mugratory behavior has been seen in patients with sepsis. Despite tremendous advances in the understanding of signaling molecules and pathways acting inside neutrophils, our understanding of the directional decision-making process of neutrophils is limited, and consequently, our abilities to modulate the activity of neutrophils restricted. The primary goal of my research is to combine single cell migratory neutrophil phenotype measurements with mathematical modeling to elucidate the mechanisms that lead to dysfunctional chemotactic behavior. Our overarching hypothesis is that ‘programming or training’ signals that control receptor desensitization have a central role in determining the final destination of migrating neutrophils. Advances in understanding neutrophil activity will come not only from molecular biology studies, but also from the development of mathematical models of cell behavior coupled with new microfluidic tools that would enable the precise quantification of neutrophil behavior at the single cell level.
